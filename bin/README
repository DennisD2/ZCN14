README for `bin' directory
----------------------------

This directory contains almost all the programs which make up ZCN -
`zcn.bin'/`zcn150.bin'/`zcn200.bin' which is the operating system
itself, `rrinit.bin' which runs under the ROM software and makes an
initial `runrom.ram' snapshot file, and various .com files which run
under ZCN.

(Note that some of the less useful programs have been moved to the
`extra' subdirectory.)

See `zcn.txt' in ../doc for details of how to transfer these, how to
use them, etc.

Also, see the README in ../support, which describes several other
included programs you can run on ZCN.
