NAME
	stty - set speed used by serial port

SYNOPSIS
	stty speed

DESCRIPTION
	Set speed (in bits per second) used by serial port. Supported
	speeds are 150, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, and 19200.
	ZCN's default speed is 2400 bps.

BUGS
	See last sentence above. :-) It might in theory be sensible,
	but it's very slow. Generally you'd have an stty command in
	your `autoexec.sub' to set the speed to 9600 or 19200.
