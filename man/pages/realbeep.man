NAME
	realbeep - disable/enable audible beep

SYNOPSIS
	realbeep [0|1]

DESCRIPTION
	Turn off (0) or on (1) an audible beep. (The usual `beep'
	action is to flash the screen.) The noise it makes is a little
	odd - I was trying to keep it from being annoyingly loud, and
	this was the best `beep' I managed in that respect.
