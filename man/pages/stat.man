NAME
	stat - emulate old ZCN `stat' command (like k3 and df combined)

SYNOPSIS
	stat

DESCRIPTION
	Stat gives a few bits of info, e.g.:

	Sys upgrd spc: 121 bytes
	Max prog size: 46k
	Free on drivs: A:=91k B:=156k C:=213k D:=251k

	The second line is like `k3', the last line is like `df', but
	the first line is not available from any other command.
