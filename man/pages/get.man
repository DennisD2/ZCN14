NAME
	get - read in a file at a specified address

SYNOPSIS
	get hex_address filename

DESCRIPTION
	Read the file at the given address, which must be given in
	hex.

EXAMPLES
	To read in a .com file (perhaps for patching with `poke'), use
	`get 100 foo.com'.

BUGS
	It assumes you know what you're doing, and as such it's not
	all that difficult to shoot yourself in the foot with it. :-)

SEE ALSO
	memdump, poke, save
