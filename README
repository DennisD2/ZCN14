ZCN v1.4 - CP/M-like OS for the Amstrad NC100 Notepad & NC200 Notebook.
Copyright (C) 1994-2022 Russell Marks. See `zcn.txt' for licence details.

ZCN is a CP/M-like operating system for the Amstrad NC100/NC150
(Notepad) and NC200 (Notebook). It can run most programs which run on
CP/M 2.2. You need an NC100/NC150/NC200 and preferably a PCMCIA memory
card to use it (required on NC100), and in most cases a separate
computer with a serial link is needed to get the system code to the NC
for the first time.

While ZCN is a fairly random hack, it also comes with a lot of
documentation, including a guide to programming CP/M and ZCN, and
optionally has help available from the command line.

You should probably consider using ZCN if you like the idea of a
portable CP/M box, or want to use the NC as something a bit closer to
a `real computer'. It comes together with many custom-written
utilities, as well as various free CP/M programs.

See `zcn.txt' in the `doc' subdirectory for more details.


Most text files (source and documentation) other than this one are in
Unix text format - that is, lines end in LF rather than CR/LF. Such
files should be widely supported nowadays.
