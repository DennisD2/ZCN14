# I'm not sure if it's documented anywhere, but cpmtools will give

# To use these entries in your own diskdefs file, you could e.g. just
# cat this file onto the end of your existing file using something
# along the lines of "cat this_file >>your_installed_diskdefs_file".

# That said, you should not use this first entry, which is a one-off
# used while building nc200fd.raw.
