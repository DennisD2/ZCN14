Zcnpaint is a paint program. You need a Microsoft-compatible serial
mouse (plugged into the 9-pin serial port) to use it. The last time I
used it was with a Logitech Pilot Trackball, for example.

(It also works with nc100em's co-operative mouse support, but note
that only the GTK2 version of nc100em supports that at the time of
writing.)

The NC200 is not supported.

Zcnpaint is documented in doc/zcn.txt. Look in the "ZCN external
commands" section under "ZCNPAINT".

This directory contains source only; the binary is in the 'bin/extra'
directory.
