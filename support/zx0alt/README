* README for `support/zx0alt' directory

The files in this directory are duplicates of those under the rest of
the `support' directory generally, but using ZX0 format compression.
They have not been thoroughly tested, but all should be fine to use.

The advantage of using these is, obviously, the file size. Everything
here is smaller than the original - as I tried most of them, then
removed any which wouldn't be smaller on a ZCN drive.

(The difference is particularly noticeable on programs written in
high-level languages, those are mostly about half of the original
size. For the others, it's more like two-thirds.)

The disadvantages are that they may take longer to load, and any
programs which you can ordinarily patch are no longer patchable in
this form.

The qterm.uue file is qterm.com as uuencoded, in case you want to use
it with `rexec' when installing ZCN. This version's about 30% smaller.

Credits for the ZX0 software used can be found under the top-level
directory, in man/*zx0* and doc/zcn.txt.
