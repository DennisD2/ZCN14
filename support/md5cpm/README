md5cpm is a simple md5sum program for CP/M and ZCN. It's really just a
frontend for Solar Designer's md5.c/md5.h which compiles fine in
Hitech C with the application of a big enough hammer^W^W^W^Wsome very
minor changes.

Although it is (very) slow and large, because doing tons of 32-bit
maths is a real pain on a Z80 (and Hitech C absolutely loves using
IX), it can still be useful to have as md5sum programs are widely
available on other computers - notably the md5sum from GNU coreutils,
as you can expect to find on e.g. Linux systems.

For more details (and caveats) see ../../doc/zcn.txt and the man page.

NB: Ordinarily you should use the ../zx0alt/md5cpm.com version, which
is far smaller than the one here.
