This is the BSD Unix game 'fish', hacked to compile under Hitech C.
I've included an executable here as 'fish.com'. The game should work on any
Z80-based CP/M box without modification.

The instructions aren't displayed by the program as with the original;
instead they're in a separate file, 'fishhelp.txt'. (Obviously, the
same licence applies to that file as to fish.c.)


I did the above in 1995 (adding fish-bds.c later) when the old
4-clause licence applied. However, in 1999 the following announcment
was made:

"Effective immediately, licensees and distributors are no longer required to
include the acknowledgement within advertising materials.  Accordingly, the
foregoing paragraph of those BSD Unix files containing it is hereby deleted
in its entirety."

I applied this change to all relevant files here.
