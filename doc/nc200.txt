Using ZCN on an NC200
---------------------

You should *not* normally run `zcn.bin' on an NC200, run `zcn200.bin'
instead - if you don't, some programs such as `bbcbas' and `runrom'
will crash. See zcn.txt's installation guide for more on installing
zcn200.bin.

`bigrun' and `zcnpaint' don't work on the NC200 - they will just
immediately exit.

`invaders' doesn't have a visible/usable display on the NC200.

`zdbe' will only use 10 lines of the display.

`ted200' and `bs200' should be used rather than `ted' and `bs' -
obviously they can be renamed if you prefer.

While `bbcbas' and `bbcmin' are working on the NC200 as of ZCN 1.4,
they haven't been tested much, and `bbcbas' lacks the copy cursor it
would usually have.

On the NC200, be sure to use the `light 0' command if you want to turn
off the backlight. Otherwise, ZCN will always leave it on - which
supposedly takes three times as much power as with it turned off.
