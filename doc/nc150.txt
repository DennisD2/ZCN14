Using ZCN on an NC150
---------------------

You should *not* normally run `zcn.bin' on an NC150, run `zcn150.bin'
instead - if you don't, some programs such as `bbcbas' will crash. See
zcn.txt's installation guide for more on installing zcn150.bin.

`bigrun' doesn't work on the NC150 - it will just immediately exit.

`spell' is only partially working on the NC150 - it should work for
checking word spelling, but it will never suggest any alternatives,
and limits manual replacement words to ASCII only. (`spellwd' does
work, though.)
